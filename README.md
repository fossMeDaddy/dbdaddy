# DBDaddy [draft]

A simple database management CLI tool.

safe for production use when version = `v1.0.0`

stable enough for development DB use, NOW.

## Installation
not available on windows cuz fuck you, thats why. use wsl or something...
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossMeDaddy/dbdaddy/main/installer/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage instructions
```
dbdaddy --help
```
in future, the usage guide will be available on the `man` page for the command.

## Note from the author
Look prisma is a great tool from devex pov but applications dont run on developers, they run on a machine.

But I thought, well there has to be an alternative to it, you can't just recommend prisma to your CTO right!? how will you back your decision?

With this tool, I intend to push an opinion suggesting how you should manage & query your databases.

`DBDaddy` covers the management part, I highly recommend going for type-safe query code-gen tools like `sqlc` for the query part. 
The part where we often blindly lean towards using an ORM. I believe what we really need is a GOOD ENOUGH db management tool, the SQL part is easy.
As anyone who knows how to "optimize" their React app when it goes brrrr on every state change, CAN learn & write efficient SQL.

Just define a schema, this tool will handle migrations between schema changes.

Along with that, some other useful functionality like executing SQL, backup & restore, branches, etc.

supported databases:
- [x] Postgres
- [ ] MySQL
- [ ] SQlite

## Features
Here are some features the CLI covers (for PG)
- using databases on a server like branches (like git but inferior)
- inspecting database/table schema
- deleting databases
- dumping databases
- restoring databases
- executing raw SQL queries & exporting query as formatted readable text & CSV
- SQL migration file generation between db schema changes

In Progress:
- **project structure & schema definition**
- **hybrid migrations allowing you to interleave your own sql files in between autogenerated sql** in case you are a competent developer & would like some control over your own database

Planned:
- **studio ui**, obviously because no soydev with a $1000 clerk subscription would use a CLI for more than 10s
- **db visualize & diagram**, aim is to be similar to dbdiagram.io in UI but use SQL for schema definition
- **testing suite**, everyday i push to main, i push with fear, i dont want fear

## Migrations [unstable]
it's actually simpler than most people would think... so simple in fact that I would NOT recommend it for production use (for now).

indexes, triggers & custom types are not supported.

constraints, columns, tables & views are diffed and tracked for changes but there is no modification support as of now for any of them,
which means that, let's say if you make a field nullable in SQL, this tool will generate migrations to remove the column
from your database & then re-create it with SQL column definition such that the field is now nullable. DATA WILL BE LOST.
